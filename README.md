# Documentation
In the documentation you will find how to create layout, sidebar, menus and more. Also, we document some of the key components we've created such as Chat, Popup, Cards and more.

We don't provide offline documentation. Due to the online documentation, we will be easy to make changes and will certainly make you more comfortable in reading it.

Even so, you can still access the documentation of this template at any time.
